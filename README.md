# Virtual_Mouse

A virtual mouse, also known as a software-based mouse, is a type of computer input device that enables users to control the movement of the cursor on their screen without the need for a physical mouse. This is accomplished through software that emulates the functions of a physical mouse, allowing users to click, drag, and scroll using a combination of keyboard shortcuts and other input methods.
